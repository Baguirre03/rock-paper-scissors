# rock-paper-scissors
Attempt at building rock paper scissors game, first thing including Javascript
What I learned to use:
  -CSS
  -HTML
  -JS Basics
  This project took way too long and over the course of roughly a work week.
  Styling was much easier than other projects but getting some of the code to run was a hassel.
  Definitely worth the time commitment and I feel as if the basics of JS have been understood with it.
